## Software Developer and Designer <sub><sup>when is say designer i'm not talking about frontend design, i'm talking about <i>logical design</sup></sub></i>

<p>I'm from 🇫🇷 but my heart is in 🇨🇮</p>
<p>If you need me as I'm freelance, either check my desk where I'm currently implementing Stripe payments on Symfony🎻 or shout loudly since I may be watering my outdoor jalapeño plants.🌶️</p>
<p>If I'm nowhere to be found, you may try to email me at contact@vincent-keo.com or shout louder.</p>

## Hard skills
<p>As most of my repos are private, or scattered over servers and other platforms, here's a breakdown of my language skills:</p>
- PHP | Symfony🎻 | Laravel 🀄
<br>- Java ☕ | SpringBoot 🌿
<br>- PostGreSQL 🐘 | MySQL 🦭 | MongoDB 🍃
<br>- HTML | CSS | JS 💀
<p>Teaching Python, learning as well ; Django incoming</p>
<p>I intend to become a Rust developer in the end</p>
